## Introduction
- Serverless
	- SQLite database is integrated with the application that accesses the database. The applications interact with the SQLite database read and write directly from the database files stored on disk.
- SQLite is self-contained means it requires minimal support from the operating system or external library. This makes SQLite usable in any environment especially in embedded devices like iPhones, Android phones, game consoles, handheld media players, etc.
- Database is a group of tables
- Python comes with SQLite, so we don't need to explicitly install it. 
	- `import sqlite3`
- For GUI, we can use _SQLiteStudio_
