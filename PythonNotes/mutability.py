"""
Some objects in Python are mutable, whereas, some are immutable.

Basically, mutable data types in Python are those whose value can be changed in place after they have been created.
This statement might have added two more questions to your mind - What is "in-place"? And, what kind of "values can be changed" ??

1) What is "in-place" ?

By in-place, we mean that, any operation that changes the content of anything without making a separate copy of it. For example, we can directly add, remove, or update the values of a list in Python, without creating a new list.
